We would like to extend our apologies for an error reported in Table 1 of the paper titled "Durability of the Effectiveness of Heterologous COVID-19 Vaccine Regimens in Thailand: Retrospective Cohort Study Using National Registration Data."
Regarding the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe COVID-19 for 3-dose regimens, there are two typographical errors in the column "Months since the last dose to VE = 50%." Specifically:
• For the AZ-AZ-PZ regimen, "1.8" should be corrected to "8.8."
• For the AZ-AZ-MN regimen, "1.3" should be corrected to "8.3."
